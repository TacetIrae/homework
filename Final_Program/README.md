In the following program I used several methods that I learned during the time I studied in GeekBrains. First of all I started off by creating several methods.
1) First Method is used in order to fill my array with the variables that user chooses. It is pretty simple method that is easy to use.
2) Second thing that I added, is method that prints the following function, is is mostly the same as fill array method, but insides it prints it out.
3) Third method I created is a method that is used to sort the array and output new array. 
Its function to check the length of each position of the array and evaluate if it is shorted than 4 characters that it could be added to the new array.
This sorting method sorts those that are shorter than 4 characters into separate array and prints them out showing new array.

If I would to improve this, I would decide to choose to give user a choise to choose, how many characters max should be there, give program more defence
against fault input and maybe look or browse for methods that other people used to minimaze resourses that it is used to run the folling program.
